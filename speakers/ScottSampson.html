                  and
                  evolution of late Cretaceous dinosaurs and he has conducted fieldwork in a number of countries in
                  Africa.

            Scott Sampson is a Canadian-born paleontologist who received his Ph.D. in zoology from the
            University of
            Toronto. His doctoral work focused on
            two new species of ceratopsids (horned dinosaurs) from the Late Cretaceous of Montana, as
            well
            as the
            growth and function of certopsid horns and frills.<br>
            <br>
            Following graduation in 1993, Sampson spent a year working at the American Museum of Natural
            History in
            New York City, followed by five years as assistant professor of anatomy at the New York
            College
            of
            Osteopathic Medicine on Long Island. He arrived at the University of Utah accepting a dual
            position as
            assistant professor in the Department of Geology and Geophysics and curator of vertebrate
            paleontology
            at the Utah Museum of Natural History. His research interests largely revolve around the
            phylogenetics,
            functional morphology, and evolution of Late Cretaceous dinosaurs.<br>
            <br>
            In addition to his museum and laboratory-based studies, Sampson has conducted
            paleontological
            work in
            Zimbabwe, South Africa, and
            Madagascar, as well as the United States and Canada. He was also the on-air host for the
            Discovery
            Channel's Dinosaur Planet and recently completed a book, Dinosaur Odyssey: Fossil Threads in
            the
            Web of
            Life, which is one of the most comprehensive surveys of dinosaurs and their worlds to date.
