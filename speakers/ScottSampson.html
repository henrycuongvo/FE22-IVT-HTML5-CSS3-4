                            evolution of late Cretaceous dinosaurs and he has conducted fieldwork in a number of

                Scott Sampson is a Canadian-born paleontologist who received his Ph.D. in zoology from the University of
                Toronto. His doctoral work focused on
                two new species of ceratopsids (horned dinosaurs) from the Late Cretaceous of Montana, as well as the
                growth and function of certopsid horns and frills.<br>
                <br>
                Following graduation in 1993, Sampson spent a year working at the American Museum of Natural History in
                New York City, followed by five years as assistant professor of anatomy at the New York College of
                Osteopathic Medicine on Long Island. He arrived at the University of Utah accepting a dual position as
                assistant professor in the Department of Geology and Geophysics and curator of vertebrate paleontology
                at the Utah Museum of Natural History. His research interests largely revolve around the phylogenetics,
                functional morphology, and evolution of Late Cretaceous dinosaurs.<br>
                <br>
                In addition to his museum and laboratory-based studies, Sampson has conducted paleontological work in
                Zimbabwe, South Africa, and
                Madagascar, as well as the United States and Canada. He was also the on-air host for the Discovery
                Channel's Dinosaur Planet and recently completed a book, Dinosaur Odyssey: Fossil Threads in the Web of
                Life, which is one of the most comprehensive surveys of dinosaurs and their worlds to date.
